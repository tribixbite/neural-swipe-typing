# Project Memory - Neural Swipe Typing

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… English Adaptation (Complete)

Successfully adapted the neural swipe typing training pipeline from Cyrillic to English in 4 systematic phases:

**Phase 1: Character Set & Tokenizers**
- Updated `src/ns_tokenizers.py`: Changed `ALL_CYRILLIC_LETTERS_ALPHABET_ORD` (33 chars) to `ALL_ENGLISH_LETTERS_ALPHABET_ORD` (26 chars)
- Updated `src/feature_extraction/feature_extractors.py`: Import English alphabet and set as default allowed keys
- Removed Cyrillic character substitutions from `src/grid_processing_utils.py`

**Phase 2: Model Architecture Constants**
- Updated all `CHAR_VOCAB_SIZE` from 37 to 30 in `src/model.py` (26 letters + 4 special tokens)
- Updated all `n_keys` and `n_elements` parameters from 37 to 30
- Updated `src/train.ipynb`: Changed `num_classes` from 35 to 28

**Phase 3: English Keyboard Layout**
- Created `data/data_preprocessed/gridname_to_grid.json` with standard QWERTY layout
- Created `data/data_preprocessed/voc.txt` with ~100 common English words
- Generated proper key positions and hitboxes for English keyboard

**Phase 4: Configuration Updates & Testing**
- Updated all config files in `configs/` directory: `n_classes` from 35 to 28
- Successfully tested model initialization with English configuration
- Verified tokenizer compatibility and vocabulary size consistency

**Key Technical Changes:**
- Vocabulary: 26 English letters + 4 special tokens = 30 total
- Model output: n_classes = 28 (excluding `<sos>` and `<pad>` tokens)
- Keyboard: Standard QWERTY layout with proper coordinates
- All dimension constants updated consistently across codebase

**Testing Status:** âœ… PASSED
- Model initializes correctly with new English parameters
- Tokenizers work with English vocabulary  
- All architecture constants properly aligned

## Next Steps

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Training
The codebase is now fully adapted for English and ready for:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather real English swipe gesture training data
2. **Training**: Run training pipeline with English configuration
3. **Evaluation**: Test model performance on English swipe typing

### ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements
- Expand English vocabulary beyond current 100 words
- Add more comprehensive English training dataset
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters for English language characteristics
